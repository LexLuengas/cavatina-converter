# see feature list here:
# http://www.logilab.org/card/pylintfeatures

# C0301:	Line too long (%s/%s) Used when a line is longer than a given number of characters.
# 
# C0302:	Too many lines in module (%s) Used when a module has too much lines, reducing its readibility.

# C0103:	Invalid name "%s" (should match %s) Used when the name doesn't match the regular expression associated to its type (constant, variable, class...).
# 

# C0324:	Comma not followed by a space Used when a comma (",") is not followed by a space.

# W0621:	
# Redefining name %r from outer scope (line %s) Used when a variable's name hide a name defined in the outer scope.


# W0511:	Used when a warning note as FIXME or XXX is detected.


# W0404:	Reimport %r (imported line %s) Used when a module is reimported multiple times.
# we do this all the time in unit tests

# R0201:	Method could be a function Used when a method doesn't use its bound instance, and so could be written as a function.

# R0904:	Too many public methods (%s/%s) Used when class has too many public methods, try to reduce this to get a more simple (and so easier to use) class.

#E1101:	%s %r has no %r member Used when a variable is accessed for an unexistant member.

# R0914:	Too many local variables (%s/%s) Used when a function or method has too many local variables.
# many of our test use many local variables

#R0903:	Too few public methods (%s/%s) Used when class has too few public methods, so be sure it's really worth it.

#R0911:	Too many return statements (%s/%s) Used when a function or method has too many return statement, making it hard to follow.
